# blueberrypy

This is still under development. Check back in a week or two. 

This project was created/started due to a lack of good Bluetooth Low Energy support out there for Python. There's really good support for NodeJS and GoLang, but for python there's just a whole bunch of libraries and none of them seem to be complete with Bluetooth Low Energy support. I plan on changing that with this library (blueberrypy). The features I plan to support in the first phase (week 1) are:

- Enable/disabling scanning
- Parsing advertisement data 
- Python callback with parsed advertisement
- Connect/disconnect BleDevice
- Discovery of services and characteristics 
- Read/write characteristic
